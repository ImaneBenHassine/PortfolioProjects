# PortfolioProjects

To know any tool or technology, it is always better to go through a case study or self-derived project. And the best way to learn machine learning is by designing and completing small projects and cover the key steps. Namely, from loading data, summarizing data, evaluating algorithms and making some predictions.

Python is a popular and powerful interpreted language that can be used for both research and development and developing production systems.

A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.

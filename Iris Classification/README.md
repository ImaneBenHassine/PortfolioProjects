The best small project to start with on a new tool is the classification of iris flowers. It is a multi-class classification problem, allowing to practice supervised learning algorithm in which models learn using training data, and apply those learnings to new data.

### Attribute Information:
The dataset is famous almost as the “hello world” dataset in machine learning and statistics by pretty much everyone, contains 150 observations of iris flowers of 4 columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters and the last column is the species of the flower observed.

Data Source : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class: Iris Setosa / Iris Versicolour / Iris Virginica

All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.

### Steps

- Installing the Python and SciPy platform.
- Load the dataset.
- Summarize the dataset.
- Visualize the dataset.
- Evaluating algorithms.
- Making predictions.

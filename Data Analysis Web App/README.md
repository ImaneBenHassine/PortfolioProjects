In this project I create a web app for __EDA__ Exploratory Data Analysis using __Python__ and __Streamlit__ which is an open-source python library helps to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

The code will be written in the __Anaconda Spyder__ since it is a powerful Python IDE with advanced editing plus all the libraries for ML are pre-installed in Anaconda.

let's start by installing Streamlit in Anaconda Prompt :
                 
                 pip install streamlit
                 streamlit Hello
